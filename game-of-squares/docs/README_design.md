# Design Planning

Plan to design

Excellent — you are already thinking in game theory terms, which is exactly the correct lens. What you currently have is the seed of a retention loop, not just a gimmick coupon game. Let’s iterate this properly.

I’m going to:

Tighten the core concept

Do Iteration #1 — make it viable

Do Iteration #2 — make it habit-forming

Design incentives that scale beyond 10 users

Warn you about the biggest mistake people make with games like this

Core Idea (Refined)

You are not building a coupon game.

You are building a collection mechanic disguised as a coupon game.

Humans LOVE:

claiming territory

completing sets

revealing hidden things

watching progress grow

returning to finish unfinished work

Your “garden” metaphor is excellent — it triggers ownership psychology.

So the real product becomes:

“Come claim your square before someone else does.”

Now we add structure.

Iteration #1 — Make the Game Actually Work

Keep this version extremely simple.

Do NOT over-engineer yet.

Game Board

12 hidden tiles

Each tile reveals part of a larger image

Clicking claims the tile permanently (for that user)

Important:

Do NOT require memory yet.

Memory games add friction.

Friction kills participation.

Instead:

👉 Click → Reveal → Reward
Fast dopamine.

Incentive Structure (First Pass)

Instead of “remember the image,” the excitement should come from the reveal itself.

When a square is clicked:

Weighted random reward:

Example:

70% → 1% coupon

25% → 2% coupon

5% → 3% coupon

Why?

If all are equal, the 3% feels normal.

Scarcity creates perceived value.

Psychological Trick (VERY Powerful)

When a user gets 1%, show this:

“Nice — but a few players uncover higher rewards…”

Now they want another square.

You just created tension.

Board Completion Reward

When all 12 squares are claimed:

Give something better than 3%.

Example:

👉 Guaranteed 10% coupon
OR
👉 Free shipping

Now completion matters.

Completion is one of the strongest behavioral drives in humans.

(See: progress bars, video games, stamp cards)

Iteration #2 — Now We Build Habit Formation

This is where your garden idea becomes lethal (in a good way).

The Garden Mechanic

Active boards → move into “Your Garden”

Show them visually stacked.

People LOVE visible history.

It says:

“I’ve been here before.”

Now you are no longer a store.

You are a place they return to.

Add Time Scarcity

After finishing a board:

“A new garden plot unlocks in 24 hours.”

Congratulations.

You just created a daily return loop.

This is the same mechanic used by:

Wordle

mobile games

Duolingo

gachas

Simple works.

Optional — Session Coupon (VERY SMART IDEA)

You suggested coupons active only during the session.

That is extremely strong if used carefully.

Example:

“This reward expires in 20 minutes.”

Watch conversion spike.

But — IMPORTANT — do NOT do this for all coupons.

Only for higher tiers.

Otherwise it feels manipulative.

Share Incentive — How To Do It Correctly

Most share mechanics fail because they feel forced.

Never say:

“Share this!”

Instead say:

“Claim an extra tile if a friend joins your garden.”

Now sharing = progress.

Not marketing.

Mechanic:

User gets a link:

yourstore.com/garden?ref=wizard123


When friend clicks:

Both receive:

👉 One bonus tile.

That is extremely motivating.

Scaling Beyond 10 Users

Here is where most people accidentally destroy their game.

DO NOT make tiles globally claimable.

Bad:

“Only one person can claim each tile.”

That kills late players.

Instead:

Each user gets their own board.

Always.

Zero competition at first.

Competition is an advanced mechanic.

When You Eventually Want Scale

Later you can introduce:

Community Garden

Example:

“Help the community reveal the Spring Garden — when 10,000 tiles are claimed globally everyone gets 15% off.”

Now you have cooperative gameplay.

VERY sticky.

One Critical Warning

Do NOT make the reward too small relative to the effort.

If someone clicks 12 times and gets:

1% off…

They will never play again.

Even if mathematically fair.

Perception > math.

Always.

Your Ideal Flow (3 Click Goal)

You were correct to target this.

Let’s refine it:

Click 1: See board → curiosity
Click 2: Reveal tile → dopamine
Click 3: View reward → optional purchase

Perfect.

No signup walls yet.

Capture email AFTER reward if desired.

Never before.

Advanced Lever (Save This For Later)

If this works, introduce:

Streak Bonuses

“Claim tiles 3 days in a row → unlock Gold Garden.”

People will return irrationally to avoid breaking streaks.

Humans hate losing progress more than they enjoy gaining it.

(loss aversion)

The REAL Strategy You’re Building

Not a coupon engine.

You are building:

👉 A return mechanic.

Traffic is expensive.

Returning users are gold.

My Strong Recommendation

Launch ugly.

Launch simple.

Do NOT wait for perfection.

You are testing behavior — not art.

Even placeholder images are fine.

If you want, next I can design:

✅ The optimal reward table
✅ Probability math
✅ Anti-abuse mechanics
✅ Database structure (Mongo-friendly)
✅ UI layout psychology
✅ Copy that increases clicks
✅ A version that subtly pushes higher cart values

Just tell me how deep you want to go.
