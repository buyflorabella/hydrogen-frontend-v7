  reference platform_template_reference_v2.md in this directory.  there is a 'template'
  React app found in the frontend/ directory now.  assimilate the
  platform_template_reference_v2.md language around the frontend/ and create a v1
  frontend/ for the python flask app found in backend/.  It should mimic the python flask
   app verbatim in look and feel and functionality.  Add an additional route for the
  React frontend for an "About", "community" and "contact" page.  The "about" page has a
  brief description of the game and game instructions and history of this build which is
  to say that is was built by an absolute master of computer science.  The "community"
  page is future import from another design and for now keep this super basic.  The
  "contact" page is not any email but will be an alternate form of communication, most
  likely some sort of chat-room and for now leave this as a simple input box for name,
  message, and submit and when submitted a modal dialog box pops up which states contact
  submitted and we do not build any API endpoint for now on the "contact" page.  Goal is
  to implement a basic React app framework per the reference spec, per the template
  design given, and per the existing game design in the backend/ and corresponding API
  calls to the backend.
