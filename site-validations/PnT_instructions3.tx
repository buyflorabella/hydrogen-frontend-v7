Task: Build Flask-based UI in /backend
Goal
Create a complete Python Flask interface (frontend + backend UI) without modifying the existing framework code.

Steps

1. Create a new subfolder `/backend` in the project root.
2. Initialize a Flask application inside `/backend` with proper folder structure (`templates`, `static`, etc.).
3. Build UI components in Flask (HTML/Jinja templates, CSS, JS) to mirror or wrap interactions with the existing framework.
4. Implement backend Flask routes that will execute bash scripts and return results to the UI.
5. Ensure the Flask app reads outputs from the bash scripts and displays them cleanly in the frontend.
6. Include error handling and logging for script execution.
7. Keep the Flask interface completely decoupled from the existing frontend framework; no changes to original code.

Done When

1. Flask app in `/backend` successfully executes backend bash scripts and returns output to the UI.
2. Frontend UI in Flask fully functional, responsive, and independent from the existing codebase.

Notes

- Do not touch or import anything from the existing framework code.
- Focus only on `/backend` folder for all Flask implementation.
- Ensure the interface can handle multiple script executions and display results dynamically.
- Consider basic authentication or session management for secure script execution if needed.
